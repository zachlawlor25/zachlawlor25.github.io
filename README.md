## Web map showing locations of sporting venues in the United States and Canada.

Web map showing locations of sporting venues in the United States and Canada. This data was pulled from HILFD as a shapefile. Data was then merged with a tabluar format of data with more descriptive information regarding each stadium/arena. Using Qgis, data was then converted to geojson format to be used in conjunction with the leaflet api to produce this webmap.
